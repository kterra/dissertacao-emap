abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are becoming increasingly popular in towns and cities around the world. They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments. This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a particular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system's extent, infers the likely demographics and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such patterns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the system area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of transport research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more easily modelled and validated. Such work lays foundations for the analysis of larger scale transport systems by creating a classification of the different systems and seeks to demonstrate that bike-shares have a lot to offer both as an effective method of transport and a rich source of data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Public transportation systems (PTSs) play an important role in modern cities, providing shared/massive transportation services that are essential for the general public. However, due to their increasing complexity, designing effective methods to visualize and explore PTS is highly challenging. Most existing techniques employ network visualization methods and focus on showing the network topology across stops while ignoring various mobility-related factors such as riding time, transfer time, waiting time, and round-the-clock patterns. This work aims to visualize and explore passenger mobility in a PTS with a family of analytical tasks based on inputs from transportation researchers. After exploring different design alternatives, we come up with an integrated solution with three visualization modules: isochrone map view for geographical information, isotime flow map view for effective temporal information comparison and manipulation, and OD-pair journey view for detailed visual analysis of mobility factors along routes between specific origin-destination pairs. The isotime flow map linearizes a flow map into a parallel isoline representation, maximizing the visualization of mobility information along the horizontal time axis while presenting clear and smooth pathways from origin to destinations. Moreover, we devise several interactive visual query methods for users to easily explore the dynamics of PTS mobility over space and time. Lastly, we also construct a PTS mobility model from millions of real passenger trajectories, and evaluate our visualization techniques with assorted case studies with the transportation researchers.},

The model uses multiple levels of abstraction in order to bridge the gap between raw GPS sensor measurements and high level information such as a user's destination and mode of transportation. To achieve efficient inference, we apply Rao-Blackwellized particle filters at multiple levels of the model hierarchy. Locations such as bus stops and parking lots, where the user frequently changes mode of transportation, are learned from GPS data logs without manual labeling of training data. We experimentally demonstrate how to accurately detect novel behavior or user errors (e.g. taking a wrong bus) by explicitly modeling activities in the context of the user's historical data. Finally, we discuss an application called "Opportunity Knocks" that employs our techniques to help cognitively-impaired people use public transportation safely. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Isochrone maps are an established method to depict areas of equal travel time, and have been used in transportation planning since the early 20th century. In recent years, interactive isochrone maps al- lowed users to select areas of interest, or explore temporal mobility patterns for different modes of transport. However, conventional isochrone maps depict one traffic situation at a time. Our visualization approach unifies isochrone maps with time- varying travel data, and instead of showing multiple isolines for different travel times, we show multiple isolines for different times of day in order to reveal time-dependent spatial travel variance. In this paper, we present Isoscope, a web application that provides an interactive map for casual exploration of urban mobility patterns. Through its aesthetic visual form and its simple interface we strive to support people investigating travel time in their own city. We will describe our design goals, elaborate on the design and implementa- tion of our prototype, and discuss limitations and future extensions of the system.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

For calculating a convex hull many known algorithms exist, but there are fewer for calculating concave hulls. In this project we have developed and implemented an algorithm for calculating a concave hull in two dimensions that we call the Gift Opening algorithm. The idea is to first calculate the convex hull and then convert the convex hull into a concave hull. The convex hull can be calculated with any known algorithm. We implemented and compared Gift Wrapping and Divide and Conquer for this purpose. We found the performance of Divide and Conquer to be better and used that in our final prototype. We also developed and implemented the part that converts the convex hull to a concave hull. The performance and scaling of the algorithm is very good, mainly due to the optimizations we did to the algorithm and implementation. The concave hull for data sets with over 107 points can be calculated within a few seconds on an Intel Core 2 duo PC. The algorithm is also very reliable and produces a good quality concave hull even when the geometry is very odd or when the density of the points is varying.},

abstract = {This book addresses topics of mobile multi-agent systems, pattern formation, biological modelling, artificial life, unconventional computation, and robotics. The behaviour of a simple organism which is capable of remarkable biological and computational feats that seem to transcend its simple component parts is examined and modelled. In this book the following question is asked: How can something as simple as Physarum polycephalum - a giant amoeboid single-celled organism which does not possess any neural tissue, fixed skeleton or organised musculature - can approximate complex computational behaviour during its foraging, growth and adaptation of its amorphous body plan, and with such limited resources? To answer this question the same apparent limitations as faced by the organism are applied: using only simple components with local interactions. A synthesis approach is adopted and a mobile multi-agent system with very simple individual behaviours is employed. It is shown their interactions yield emergent behaviour showing complex self-organised pattern formation with material-like evolution. The presented model reproduces the biological behaviour of Physarum; the formation, growth and minimisation of transport networks. In its conclusion the book moves beyond Physarum and provides results of scoping experiments approximating other complex systems using the multi-agent approach. The results of this book demonstrate the power and range of harnessing emergent phenomena arising in simple multi-agent systems for biological modelling, computation and soft-robotics applications. It methodically describes the necessary components and their interactions, showing how deceptively simple components can create powerful mechanisms, aided by abundant illustrations, supplementary recordings and interactive models. It will be of interest to those in biological sciences, physics, computer science and robotics who wish to understand how simple components can result in complex and useful behaviours and who wish explore the potential of guided pattern formation themselves.},

The key findings indicate that in order to increase public transport usage, the service should be designed in a way that accommodates the levels of service required by customers and by doing so, attract potential users. Furthermore, the choice of transport is influenced by several factors, such as individual characteristics and lifestyle, the type of journey, the perceived service performance of each transport mode and situational variables. This suggests the need for segmentation taking into account travel attitudes and behaviours.

The personal information include gender, occupation, income, and car ownership, while the travel information include the mode choice, walking time, waiting time, in-vehicle time, fare, comfort, etc. There were 524 valid respondents in the RP/SP survey. These 524 individuals were categorized into three groups using cluster analysis based on their personal information. It was found that people from the three groups had very different characteristics, indicating the cluster analysis worked well. In addition, six travel scenarios were designed for each respondent to ask their travel mode choice. Then, the travel mode choices were estimated using a discrete choice model and compared with the mode choices in the RP/SP survey for each group. It was found that the accuracy rate of the mode choice estimation using individual grouping were remarkably higher than that without grouping, indicating that the individual grouping improved the travel behavior estimation.},

abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to ascertain the effect of socio-demographic constraints on dimension of travel choice. This study also seeks to derive personal ecological explanations for variation in travel preference, travel intention and travel choice behavior of a wide range of destinations. Design/methodology/approach – A large representative sample of 49,105 Australian respondents is utilized. Binary logistic regression is used to determine the impact of constraint variables. Findings – Age, income and life stage have significant differential and interactive effects on travel behavior. Socio-demographic variables act in different ways to constrain/free different types of travel behavior. However there are significant levels of travel by even the most constrained groups as well as significant amounts of non-travel by the least constrained sectors of our society. These impacts are country specific. Research limitations/implications – The travel motivations of constraint groups need to be considered to order better understand travel behavior. Investigation of psychological and ecological facilitators and constraints to travel is needed. Practical implications – This information is most useful for market segmentation and the development of constraint group destination marketing plans. Managers can use utilize such results to minimize the barriers to travel by particular groups. Originality/value – This paper utilizes a large database to provide insights into the personal ecological constraints to travel.},

abstract = {The generalized nested logit (GNL) model is a new member of the generalized extreme value family of models. The GNL provides a higher degree of flexibility in the estimation of substitution or cross-elasticity between pairs of alternatives than previously developed generalized extreme value (GEV) models. The GNL model includes the paired combinatorial logit (PCL) and cross-nested logit (CNL) models as special cases. It also includes the product differentiation (PD) model, which represents the elasticity structure associated with multi-dimensional choices, and the ordered generalized extreme value model, which represents the elasticity structure associated with ordered alternatives, as special cases. The GNL model includes the two-level nested logit (NL) model as a special case and can approximate closely multi-level nested logit models. It accommodates differential cross-elasticity among pairs of alternatives through the fractional allocation of each alternative to a set of nests, each of which has a distinct logsum or dissimilarity parameter. An empirical example of intercity mode choice confirms the statistical superiority of the GNL model to the paired combinatorial logit, cross-nested logit and nested logit models and indicates important differences in cross-elasticity relationships across pairs of alternatives.},

abstract = {I n the global search for effective policies to reduce driving and its associated undesirable environmental and social consequences, land use  is often con-sidered to serve a mobility role. The basic idea is to " get the land use right " by designing an urban form with relatively high density, mixed use, and pedes-trian friendliness so that alternatives to driving are promoted and demand for automobility can be reduced. Observing decades of discussion of social-cost-based transportation pricing, the advocates of " get the land use right " do not believe that true market pricing of transportation is a feasible way to manage travel growth. Thus, they promote land use as the second best solution (Cervero, , ; Cervero {\&} Landis, ). Examples of land use-based mobility initia-tives include densification through infill development, transit-oriented develop-ment, neotraditional neighborhood design, and, more broadly, smart growth (Bernick {\&} Cervero, ; Calthorpe, ; Cervero, ; Duany et al., ; Katz, ; Newman {\&} Kenworthy, ; Urban Land Institute, ). The efficacy of " get the land use right " for reducing driving, however, has often been questioned. Challenges have come from proponents of " get the price right. " These observers note that the linkage between land use and transportation has weakened in the U.S. and other developed countries because of decreasing real costs of travel, existence of already well developed transportation systems, and structural shifts to an information-based economy (Dunn, ; Giuliano, ; Gordon et al., ). In this view, effective remedies for the problems associated with existing travel will come not from modifying land use, but from economic measures such as road pricing or general taxation to internalize the full costs of travel. A key factor in their policy debate is properly identifying the mobility role of land use in people's travel decisions. The past decade or so has seen an explo-sion of articles investigating the relationship between land use and travel behav-ior. Nevertheless, even after many studies, results remain mixed on the existence, significance, and magnitude of these relationships.  For more informed policy-making, it is essential to improve our understanding of both the potential and limitations of land use in influencing travel behavior. Previous studies have indicated that improvements in policy research can be made in at least two directions. The first is to improve methodologies. A known weakness of existing studies is their methodological inadequacies, for example, lack of a sound theo- This article presents a study that ana-lyzed the influence of land use on travel mode choice using survey data from Metropolitan Boston and Hong Kong. In Boston, the focus of inquiry was on whether land use would still matter for mode choice (and if so, to what extent) when mode attributes and traveler socio-economic characteristics were taken into account. In Hong Kong, where the role of land use in mode choice is obvious due to the densely built environment, the focus was on whether land use completely explained the transit-domi-nated travel pattern. The empirical modeling confirmed that the role of land use in influencing travel was independent from travel time and monetary costs. Elasticity estimates show that the composite effect of land use on driving could be comparable in magnitude to that of driving cost. Yet being place specific, land use strategies are limited by the spatial extent to which they can be implemented. Land use strategies influence travel more effectively when complemented by pricing policies.},
